        Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have been gaining a lot of attention in the past few months and you might be wondering what they are. NFTs allow people to sell digital assets such as art, music, images, videos, etc to others with the use of blockchain technology. Every NFT is completely unique and cannot be duplicated or exchanged.\nThe purpose of this Playground is to show you how NFTs are created (minted) behind the scenes and how the overall technology works. We will be creating out own NFT store using a simulated blockchain.
